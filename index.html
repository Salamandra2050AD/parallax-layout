        Despite their namesake and relatively puny stature, mantis shrimp aren’t
        shrimp at all. (Neither, of course, are they mantises.) They're
        stomatopods, distant relatives to crabs, shrimp, and lobsters.
        "Beautiful" and "deadly" are two descriptors you don’t typically see
        attached to shrimp. But the mantis shrimp is in a class of its own. This
        colorful specimen has earned a reputation for being one of the most
        fearsome creatures of the deep.
      </p>
      <p>
        Stomatopods began evolving independently from other crustaceans nearly
        400 million years ago, about 170 million years before the first
        dinosaurs appeared on the scene. Since then they’ve followed an
        isolated, evolutionary lineage that’s resulted in some of their more
        unique characteristics. Their biology is so bizarre that scientists have
        assigned them the nickname "shrimp from Mars."

        The peacock mantis shrimp (Odontodactylus scyllarus) uses two appendages
        called dactyl clubs to pummel its prey like aquatic Rock 'Em Sock 'Em
        Robots—that is, if kids’ toys could punch fast enough to boil water and
        split fingers to the bone. These wrecking ball "fists" spring forth from
        their bodies at 50 mph, accelerating quicker than a .22-caliber bullet.
        At those speeds, the water surrounding them briefly reaches the
        temperature of the Sun’s surface. When the dactyl clubs hit their
        target, they deliver 160 pounds of force, smashing through shells like a
        lightning-fast crab mallet.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mantis shrimp come in a variety of species, and we’re aware of about 550
        of them. Stomatopods from different species range in size from smaller
        than an inch to longer than a foot. They’re usually classified by murder
        method—either smashing, as detailed above, or spearing. In place of
        dactyl clubs, spearers have two sharp appendages on the front of their
        bodies built for harpooning prey. Spear-wielding mantis shrimp don’t
        move as fast as their club-fisted counterparts (their strikes are about
        10 times slower), but the threat of death by impalement is intimidating
        on its own.
      </p>
      <p>
        The mantis shrimp’s super-powered punching abilities raise a puzzling
        question: How can the animal deliver such a deadly blow without injuring
        itself? To get to the bottom of the mystery, researchers looked at the
        composition of the peacock mantis shrimp’s built-in weaponry. They found
        that the creature’s dactyl clubs consisted of an outer coating of
        hydroxyapatite, a hard crystalline calcium-phosphate ceramic material.
        Beneath the surface lies the key to the animal’s anti-fracturing
        qualities. Layers of elastic polysaccharide chitin underlying the shell
        are positioned in a way to act as shock absorbers, reducing the
        possibility of cracks. The design is so effective that researchers
        modeled a new type of carbon fiber material after it with potential
        applications in aircraft panels and military body armor.

        Peacock mantis shrimp have the most complex set of peepers in the animal
        kingdom. Each eye contains 12 photoreceptors that allow them to sense
        different types of color. For comparison, human eyes typically contain
        three types of light-sensitive cells for seeing red, blue, and green.
        This has led some to conclude that mantis shrimp perceive the world in a
        psychedelic rainbow of vibrant color we can’t begin to comprehend. But
        in reality, the crustaceans are actually worse at differentiating
        between subtle variations in hue than we are.
      </p>
      <p>
        A study from the University of Queensland found that when mantis shrimp
        were shown colors with a difference in wavelength less than 25
        nanometers, they had trouble telling them apart. But just because mantis
        shrimp may not see the variations between powder blue and periwinkle
        doesn’t mean their vision isn’t extraordinary. On the contrary, their
        optic abilities are on a completely separate level from ours,
        functioning more like a satellite than anything found in nature.
        Scientists believe that mantis shrimp take all the visual information
        they see into their brains at once without processing it, allowing them
        to react to their surroundings as quickly as possible. Their
        independently roaming eyes and trinocular vision also make them
        excellent hunters.

      <p>
        In addition to the all epic abilities listed above, mantis shrimp are
        one of the only creatures capable of seeing polarized light. This has
        allowed them to develop a secret code that’s undetectable to other
        species. The Haptosquilla trispinosa species of mantis shrimp wields
        feathery feeding appendages called maxillipeds that are marked with
        iridescent, blue spots. The cells of these features reflect light in a
        unique way. Instead of bouncing light into a reflective structure like
        the polarizing cells developed by humans, the cells distribute light
        across the spot’s surface. The brilliant light is plainly visible to
        other mantis shrimp, allowing them to signal members of their species
        while staying hidden from predators.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s only natural that a creature as ferocious as the stomatopod would
        have a threatening call to match. California mantis shrimp have been
        known to make low, rumbling growling sounds both in the wild and the
        lab. Male mantis shrimp often emit grunts at dawn and dusk, the periods
        of the day when they’re most likely to be hunting for food or guarding
        their homes. Scientists theorize that the growls are meant to attract
        mates and ward off competitors.

        You’d think a mantis shrimp’s technicolor exterior would make it a
        staple at most aquariums, but this creature is rarely kept in captivity.
        The same dactyl clubs that allow them to shatter shellfish are also
        capable of cracking a glass tank. When aquariums do accept a ruthless
        specimen into their collection, it must kept behind shatterproof acrylic
        glass. On top of that, a captive mantis shrimp needs to be the sole
        occupant of its specially constructed home, lest it decides to treat its
        tank-mates as punching bags.

          THEY PRACTICE SOCIAL MONOGAMY

    <section class="section section-dark">
      <p>
        The life of a mantis shrimp isn’t all cold-blooded killing. Some species
        of stomatopods are known to engage in the rare practice of social
        monogamy, a behavior that’s especially remarkable among crustaceans.
        This means mantis shrimp will choose one partner to share food, shelter,
        and raise offspring with over the course of a lifetime. What may sound
        romantic to humans serves a practical purpose for mantis shrimp.
        Research has shown that certain mantis shrimp tend to cluster outside
        reefs instead of living in the heart of the action. Without the need to
        go looking for someone new to mate with on a regular basis, mantis
        shrimp couples are able to enjoy a relatively safe, sedentary lifestyle
        secluded from predators.
